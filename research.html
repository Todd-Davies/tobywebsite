      <h3>Research</h3>
    </div>


        <p> I am a PhD Researcher in the School of Music at the University of Leeds, specialising in music for screen media. My thesis investigates library music (i.e. "stock music") and its use in television production. Although library music has played a fundamental role in the use of sound in screen media since the early twentieth century, most references to library music within the field of musicology are by way of exclusion. The intention of this project is to illuminate the process of composition, placement and reception of library music as an integral part of the television industry. My research is funded by the AHRC through the White Rose College of the Arts & Humanities (WRoCAH).
</p>
<p>
Alongside my research, I am a composer for television, theatre and the concert hall. My music is regularly broadcast on primetime television (BBC, ITV, C4) and is distributed worldwide by major labels including Universal and BMG. My concert and film work has been performed and recorded by ensembles including the BBC Singers and the Cavaleri Quartet, in venues such as Wigmore Hall, LSO St Luke’s and Abbey Road Studios. I’ve also written musicals which have been performed across the UK. Most recently, A Theory of Justice: The Musical! received its London premiere at the Arts Theatre, West End, after successful runs in Oxford, Edinburgh and Cardiff.
</p>
<p>

I hold a First Class degree in Music from the University of Oxford and a Masters in Composition with Distinction from the Guildhall School of Music and Drama.
