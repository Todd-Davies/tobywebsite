      <h3>Teaching</h3>
    </div>

<div class="text-justify">
    <p>I studied at Oxford University and the Guildhall School of Music and Drama and hold a PGCE in Secondary Education. I have taught in a range of independent and state schools across the UK, most recently leading the music department in a large sixth form college in the north of England. I am also a GCSE Music examiner and have worked on education projects for the Barbican's Creative Learning division, the One Foundation and Oxfordshire County Music Service. </p><br>
<p>
I regularly tutor piano and music theory (to grade 8), and composition and academic music (GCSE, A-Level and undergraduate degree level). I usually tutor online via Skype but can also travel. For more information or to arrange a lesson, please <a href="contact.html" class="underline">click here</a> to get in touch!

"Just to let you know for my Music A level I got an A grade so am very happy! Thanks again so much for all your invaluable help with the composition and also my personal statement." </em>- Steph

"Toby came in late in the day to help my son with his GCSE music and was of great help to him both academically and with his confidence. He's an excellent tutor and I'd highly recommend him!" </em>- Steve
</p><br>
<p><em>

"Toby is a really excellent tutor, who has greatly helped our son in the months he has been teaching him. He has a warm and unintimidating approach, but at the same time is well-organised and focused, and plans very well what needs doing. Highly recommended." </em> - Jeremy
